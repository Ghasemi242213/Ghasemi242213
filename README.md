  <em>Precision in molecular interactions</em>
</p>

I am a Professor of Biology with a deep research focus on **Bioinformatics & Computational Biology**. My work bridges the gap between **biological complexity** and **computational precision**, with specialized interests in:

*   **Protein Structure-Function Analysis**
*   **Genomic Data Mining & Curation**
*   **Algorithm Development for Biological Databases**
*   **Automation of Wet-Lab & In-Silico Pipelines using Python**

The core of my research is understanding life's mechanisms at the molecular level and building tools to decipher them.
