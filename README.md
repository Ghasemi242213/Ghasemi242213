</p>

I am a computational biologist deeply fascinated by the intersection of **life sciences** and **data science**. My research and work are centered on **Bioinformatics & Computational Biology**, with a strong focus on extracting meaningful insights from complex biological data.

### 🔍 Core Interests
*   **Protein Analysis & Structural Bioinformatics:** Investigating protein structure, function, and interactions using computational models.
*   **Biological Databases & Data Mining:** Developing and utilizing resources to manage, query, and interpret large-scale genomic and proteomic datasets.
*   **Automation & Tool Development:** Building robust, reproducible pipelines and software in **Python** to automate analyses and empower scientific discovery.

### 🛠️ Technical Approach
I believe in the power of **Python** and its scientific ecosystem (e.g., Biopython, Pandas, Scikit-learn) as foundational tools for modern biological research, enabling everything from simple scripting to advanced machine learning applications.
